    "Common words/phrases in all eight cities appear to be around the city name as well as the dwelling type. Home, House & Apartment all appeared very frequently, and in certain datasets such as Toronto, they appear the most. Given the description is a place where the lister would be describing what type of dwelling the home is in the description, this makes sense logically. Words like kitchen, shower, living room also appear often, allowing for the assumption that most Air Bnb's have basic amenities that a guest would need for their short-term stay. Another theme that can be derived from the word clouds is words related to a location such as the heart of the city, downtown, subway, walking distance & access. Using this data one can conclude that a large portion of Air Bnbâ€™s are in a location in major tourist areas of the city or close to transportation allowing people to get to these tourist areas. Given the eight cities for this report are all very large cities, this also makes sense logically. They all have tourist areas and the people traveling to these cities using Air Bnb's are likely not from the area and are traveling to the city for leisure. Both Chicago and Sydney have the license number prominent in the description whereas other cities do not. This is likely due to Airbnb regulations imposed on those two cities that hosts must include this information in their listing\n",

    "Canadian cities tend to have a higher percentage of homes in the luxury bin compared to other worldwide cities. For the non-Canadian cities, the Budget and Location groups cover almost the dataset in its entirety with the exception of LA. When exploring the latitude/longitude coordinates in the EDA stage, LA didnâ€™t have a specific cluster where properties tended to cluster so it makes sense why the Location percentage isnâ€™t as high. From the intertopic distance maps, we can infer that the majority of Airbnb renters are looking for a budget property in an area near the heart of the city center.\n",
