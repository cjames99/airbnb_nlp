# What Patterns can be found in the Unstructured Description text of Air Bnb Listings?
Airbnb offers individuals around the world thousands of unique short-term rental opportunities based on their own series of accommodation/stay requirements. This project aims to aid both renters and listers by taking a focus around data mining/knowledge discovery and leveraging text mining to uncover trends in the data related to the rental price. This will allow potential renters/listers to better understand how each listing compares to homes in their immediate area as well as other rental markets around the world, which in turn will influence the decision of their rental property selection. Using openly sourced data acquired from http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html, data mining will be conducted on data from eight worldwide cities using detailed listing CSV files scraped between the dates of December 2020 and January 2021 for each city. Each raw dataset contains multiple variables for all active and new rental properties in the past year. This data will have to be processed to remove any outliers as well as any null values to allow for a better understanding of the weight of each variable. The following cities will be the subject of this report: Toronto, Montreal, Vancouver, Chicago, Barcelona, Stockholm, Los Angeles & Sydney.
